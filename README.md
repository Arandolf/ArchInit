# ArchInit
That's my really personal arch installation script, with all my configurations and things like that. I pushed it on github 'cause i need to git clone it, so DON'T use it to install arch on your system, many things will not work properly, and you will not learn and understand the arch installation. If you really want to to use it, use it as an example for your personal script (i don't think you should, probably that's a complete shit lol).
